[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue-signals?color=a1b858&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-signals)

This package is a thin wrapper around Vue's [`ref()`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref) function that exposes the same API as SolidJS's [`createSignal()`](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest#createsignal):

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { createSignal } from 'vue-signals'

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ count() }}</h1>
  <button @click="setCount((v) => v + 1)">
    increment
  </button>
</template>
```

Technically speaking, Vue.js [`ref()`'s](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref) are already reactive signals. That's why it's easy to replicate the specific API design choices made in SolidJS.

## FAQ

### Why, Though?

Some users may prefer more explicit control over their reactive state (read/write access). For example no other code could trigger changes unless they have access to the setter.

Users new to Vue.js may be confused by the `ref()` API. It's not immediately obvious that `ref()` returns a reactive and mutable object. This is especially true for users coming from React, where `useState()` returns a tuple of `[value, setter]`.
